        <p>A match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain. For other people the reason behind it is a lot simpler: the football team managers wanted their sport to be as popular as or more popular than the most famous at that time, cricket, so they copied the number of players. ... This meant that the home team wore the numbers 1 to 11 and the away team wore numbers 12 to 22. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is known as King of the IPL Team. He is also considered as Baap of IPL Team,not only this,his terrific performance has made him win the title in 2020 as well,his followers and admirers have already started calling him Baap of IPL 2020. For someone who is known for his spot-on yorkers and is dubbed as the 'Yorker King' in his native place, Natarajan found help in the second T20I when he made smart changes to his line and length and took pace off the ball.</p>
